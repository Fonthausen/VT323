# VT323 Font Project
by Peter Hull and Jacques Le Bailly

This font was created from the glyphs of the DEC VT320 text terminal, which I used in college, and for which I have retained an unaccountable nostalgia.

I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, Python/PIL, and of course,
FontForge.  The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel
aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this
VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate
the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared
the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like
what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the
proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge
autoscanned into outlines.

I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320,
but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed
that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch or
whatever.

Further work on the typeface in 2016 by the following people
has resulted in vast improvements and a much richer glyph set.  Many
thanks to all contributors:

Contributions are welcome, subject to the SIL Open Font License v1.1, as set forth in OFL.txt in this repo.

I'm sorry I can't provide more of the original Python source for this
typeface, but a disk crash consigned the source to the great bit bucket
in the sky, in the era before I started using Github.
